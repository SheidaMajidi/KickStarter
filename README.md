# KickStarter

### The data preprocessing for the Kickstarter dataset was undertaken to prepare the data for two main tasks: 
1. Developing a classification model to predict project outcomes
2. Creating a clustering model to group projects.
### Classification models:
- Three different classification models were implemented to predict Kickstarter project outcomes: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Each model underwent hyperparameter tuning and feature importance analysis.
### Clustering models:
- Similar preprocessing as classification models, including selecting other features, more practical in clustering modeling and normalization. Isolation Forest was employed for outlier detection, following by two clustering models on the dataset: 1. K-Means 2. DBSCAN
